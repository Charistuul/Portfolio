<h1>The Best Movies According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I have to choose this movie not only because it is a classic but because if it is not on my top 5 list then my wife will be very dissapointed
     and unlike Jenny she isn't a "hoe". I understand that Jenny had it pretty rough growing up but without Forrest I think she would have been 
    truly alone in the world. So, kudos to Forrest and maybe one day we will all be lucky enought to see litttle Forrest as President.</p>

<h3>2. Braveheart</h3>
<p>What is not to love about this movie? There is love, betrayal, honor, vilains and plenty of violence seasoned with a dusting of sex.</p>

<h3>3. Christmas Vacation</h3>
<p>If you want to laugh and be equipped with an arrasy of recognizable quotes then watch this movie ... 100 times!</p>

<h3>4. A Christmas Story</h3>
<p>nostalgia meets humore in this lovable comedy</p>

<h3>5. Gladiator</h3>
<p>Because we didn't get enough blood when we watched Braveheart.</p>
